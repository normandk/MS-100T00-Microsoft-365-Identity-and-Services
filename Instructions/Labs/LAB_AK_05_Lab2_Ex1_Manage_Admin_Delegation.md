# Module 5 - Lab 2 - Exercise 1 - Manage Administration Delegation

You are the Enterprise Administrator for Adatum Corporation, and you have Microsoft 365 deployed in a virtualized lab environment. In this lab, you will manage administration delegation by assigning administrator roles to several of your users, configure Azure Rights Management and Compliance, and monitor and troubleshoot Microsoft 365. 

In this lab, you will take on the persona of Holly Dickson, Adatum’s Enterprise Administrator. If you’ll recall, in the prior lab you created Holly’s Microsoft 365 user account and assigned her the Microsoft 365 Global Administrator role. As Holly, you will now begin managing Adatum’s Microsoft 365 tenant.

### ‎Task 1 - Assign Delegated Administrators in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center

As Holly Dickson, Adatum’s Enterprise Administrator (and Microsoft 365 Global Admin), you will use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center to assign administrator rights to several users. 

1. If you’re not logged into the Domain Controller VM (LON-DC1) as **ADATUM\Administrator** and password **Pa55w.rd**, then please do so now.

2. After completing Lab 1, you are still signed into the **Microsoft 365 admin center** as the **MOD Administrator** account. In this lab, you will begin implementing Adatum’s Microsoft 365 pilot project as Holly Dickson, Adatum’s Enterprise Admin (whom you previously assigned a Microsoft 365 Global Admin role). Therefore, you must log out of Microsoft 365 as the MOD Administrator and log back in as Holly.<br/>

	On the Microsoft 365 admin center tab, select the user icon for the **MOD Administrator** (the **MA** circle) in the upper right corner of your browser, and in the **My account** pane, select **Sign out.** <br/>
	
	**Important:** When signing out of one account and signing in as another, you should close all your browser tabs except for your current tab. This is a best practice that helps to avoid any confusion by closing the windows associated with the prior user. Please close all other browser tabs now. 
	
3. In Internet Explorer browser, navigate to **https://portal.office.com**. 

4. In the **Pick an account** window, only the admin account that you just logged out from appears. Select **Use another account**. 

5. In the **Sign in** window, enter **Holly@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider). Select **Next**.

6. In the **Enter password** window, enter **Pa55w.rd** and then select **Sign in**.

7. If a **Get your work done with Office 365** window appears, select the **X** to close it. 

8. In the **Office 365 home page**, select **Admin** to open the Microsoft 365 admin center.

9. In the **Good morning/afternoon/evening Holly Dickson** window, select **Get started**.

10. In the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, in the left-hand navigation pane, select **Users** and then **Active Users**. 

11. In the **Active users** list, select **Adam Hobbs**. 

12. Adam Hobbs’s properties window displays, and the **Account** tab is displayed by default. Under the **Roles** section, select **Manage roles**. 

13. In the **Manage admin roles** window, select **Admin center access** . This enables the roles. 

14. Expand **Show All by Category**, scroll down to **Other**,   select the **Billing admin** role and then select **Save changes**. 

15. Select the **X** in the upper-right corner of the screen to close the **Admin roles updated** window.

16. Select the **X** in the upper-right corner of the screen to close the **Adam Hobbs** properties window. This returns you to the **Active users** list. 

17. Repeat steps 10 through 15 for **Ada Russell.** Assign Ada to both the **User management administrator** role and the **Helpdesk Administrator** role. 

18. Remain logged into the domain controller VM and the Microsoft 365 admin center as Holly Dickson.


### Task 2 - Assign Delegated Administrators with Windows PowerShell  

This task is similar to the prior one in that you will assign administrator rights to users; however, in this case, you will use Windows PowerShell to perform these functions rather than the Office 365 Admin Center. This will give you experience performing this management function in PowerShell, since some administrators prefer performing maintenance such as this using PowerShell.  

‎In this task, you will log into PowerShell as Holly Dickson, who is Adatum’s Enterprise Administrator.

1. On the LON-DC1 VM, navigate to the Windows PowerShell window that you left open from a previous task in Lab 1. If you closed the PowerShell window, then open it again using the same instruction as before. 

2. You should begin by running the following command that connects your PowerShell session to the Microsoft Online Service:  <br/>

	‎**Connect-MsolService**  
	
3. In the **Sign in** dialog box, log in as **Holly@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider) with password **Pa55w.rd**. 

4. PowerShell's execution policy settings dictate what PowerShell scripts can be run on a Windows system. Setting this policy to Unrestricted enables Holly to load all configuration files and run all scripts. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:   <br/>

	‎**Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted**<br/>

	‎If you are prompted to verify that you want to change the execution policy, enter **A** to select **[A]** **Yes to All.** 

5. Holly now wants to assign **Libby Hayward** to the **Service Support Administrator** role. In the Windows PowerShell window, at the command prompt, type the following command, and then press:  <br/>

	**Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleName "Service Support Administrator” –RoleMemberEmailAddress Libby@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider) 

6. Holly now wants to assign **Laura Atkins** to the **Company Administrator** role. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:   <br/>

	‎**Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleName "Company Administrator" -RoleMemberEmailAddress Laura@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com**  (where ZZZZZZ is your unique O365 Credentials) 

7. You now want to verify which users have been assigned to certain roles. Displaying the users assigned to a role is a two-step process.<br/>

	‎**Note:** Do NOT perform the following commands just yet – this is an informational step whose purpose is to simply describe what you will be doing in the remaining steps in this task. Once you understand what you will be doing, then proceed to step 8.

	- You will begin by running a command that creates a macro command ($role) that states that anytime $role is used in a cmdlet, it should retrieve all users assigned to whichever role name you’re validating.  <br/> 
		
		**&dollar;role = Get-MsolRole -RoleName "enter name of role here"**
			
	- After creating the macro in the prior step, you will then run the following command that directs PowerShell to display all object IDs for the users who have been assigned to the name of the role that you invoked in the previous $role macro.  <br/>
	
		**Get-MsolRoleMember -RoleObjectId $role.ObjectId**  ‎
			
8. You should now run the following two commands to verify that Libby was assigned to the Service Support Administrator role:  <br/> 

	**&dollar;role = Get-MsolRole -RoleName "Service Support Administrator"**<br/>

	**Get-MsolRoleMember -RoleObjectId $role.ObjectId**
	
9. Verify that **Libby Hayward** is in the list of users who have the **Service Support Administrator** role. 

10. You should now run the following two commands to verify that Laura was assigned to the Company Administrator role.<br/>

	**&dollar;role = Get-MsolRole -RoleName "Company Administrator"**<br/>

	**Get-MsolRoleMember -RoleObjectId $role.ObjectId**   

11. Verify that **Laura Atkins** is in the list of users who have the **Company Administrator** role.   <br/>

	‎**Important:** Since Global Administrators are also automatically assigned to the Company Administrator role, notice that Holly Dickson is also in this list even though she wasn’t manually assigned the role. Finally, notice that the system admin (the MOD Administrator) is also assigned to this role by default. 
	
12. You should now run the following two commands to verify which Adatum users have been assigned to the Billing Administrator role.  <br/>

	**&dollar;role = Get-MsolRole -RoleName "Billing Administrator"**  <br/>

	**Get-MsolRoleMember -RoleObjectId $role.ObjectId** 

13. Verify that **Adam Hobbs** is in the list of users who have the **Billing Administrator** role (you assigned Adam to this role in the prior task using the Microsoft 365 admin center). 

14. Leave your Windows PowerShell session open for future lab exercises; simply minimize it before going on to the next task.


### Task 3 - Verify Delegated Administration  

In this task, you will log into the Client 1 (LON-CL1) VM and then log into the Microsoft 365 admin center as various users to confirm several of the changes that you made when managing your administrative delegation in the prior tasks. 

1. Switch to the Client 1 VM (LON-CL1) by selecting the **Virtual machine** field at the top of the screen and then selecting **LON-CL1**.

2. On the log-in screen, you will log in as the **Administrator** account with a password of **Pa55w.rd**.

3. On the **Networks** window that appears, select **No**.

4. On the taskbar, select the **Microsoft Edge** icon. 

5. In your **Edge** browser navigate to **https://portal.office.com**. In the **Pick an Account** window, if **Alan Yoo** is listed then select his username; otherwise, select **Use another account** and log in as [](https://login.microsoftonline.com/)**Alan@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider).   <br/>

	‎**Note:** When entering Alan’s password, you must enter the temporary password that was assigned to Alan’s account in the prior exercise when you reset Alan’s account and had the system automatically assign him a temporary password. 

6. If a **Get your work done with Office 365** window appears, select the **X t**o close it.

7. In the **Office 365 home page**, note how the **Admin** option is not available since Alan was never assigned an administrator role. 

8. In **Microsoft Edge**, at the top right of the **Office 365 home page**, select the user icon for **Alan Yoo**, and in his **My account** pane, select **Sign out.**   <br/>

	‎**Important:** When signing out of one account and signing in as another, you should close all your browser tabs except for your current tab. This is a best practice that helps to avoid any confusion by closing the windows associated with the prior user. Please close all other browser tabs now.  
	
9. In your **Edge** browser, navigate to **https://portal.office.com** and repeat the previous sign-in steps to sign in as **Ada Russell** with a username of **Ada@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider) with the password **Pa55w.rd.** 

10. Since Ada has been assigned to an administrator role, note how **Admin** appears in the **Office 365 home page**. Select **Admin.**

11. In the **Good morning/afternoon/evening Ada Russell** window, select **Get started**.

12. On the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, select **Users** on the left-hand navigation pane and then select **Active users**. 

13. As the **Helpdesk administrator**, Ada has permission to change user passwords. In this case, Libby Hayward and Alan Yoo have reported that their passwords have been compromised. Ada has been asked to reset their passwords to a different value.   <br/>

	‎In the **Active users** list, select the **key icon (Reset a password)** to the right of **Libby Hayward’s** name. 

14. In the **Reset password** window for Libby, ensure the **Auto-generate password** option is selected, and then uncheck the **Require this user to change their password when they first sign in** checkbox if it was selected. 

15. Select **Reset**.

16. You should receive an error message indicating that you cannot reset Libby’s password because she has admin roles. In Libby’s case, she was assigned to the Service Support Admin role. Since only Global Admins can change another admin’s password, you’ll need to ask Holly Dickson to make this change. Select **Close**. 

17. In the **Active users** list, select the **key icon (Reset a password)** to the right of **Alan Yoo’s** name. 

18. In the **Reset password** window for Alan, ensure the **Auto-generate password** option is selected, and then uncheck the **Require this user to change their password when they first sign in** checkbox if it was checked. 

19. Select **Reset**.<br/>

	**IMPORTANT:** It is very important that you write down the temporary password that was automatically generated for Alan’s account. You will need this password in the next exercise when you log into Office 365 as Alan. Once you write down this password, select the **Send password in email** checkbox, and then select **Close.**

20. Select **Send email and close.** 

21. Ada has finished maintaining these accounts, so log out of the Microsoft 365 admin center by selecting the user icon for **Ada Russell** (the **AR circle**), and in her **My account** pane, select **Sign out.** 

22. Once Ada is signed out, close Microsoft Edge.
